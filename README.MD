just as a option for this data i would have to say my code already uses custom encryption didn't read the site yet cause i was thinking that is a example would have to do with what I'm trying but the thought of this level of making data is ridicules and the effort that takes is beyond me so with that said I am lost at the moment and it is a new algorithm if someone has the know how please look into custom format code that i made they are rarely published the data looks to be a new way of coding network related stuff already on internet and you can have that transcribed after you analyze the packets the coding is unique 
python app.py
python data_analysis.py
pip install -r "c:\Users\bpier\Desktop\random data\requirements.txt"
Overall, the primary data type being processed in the code is a string, but various other data types (like dictionaries and floats) are used to store intermediate results and perform calculations.
The term Custom Format The term Custom Format refers to a file format that is specifically defined or created for a particular application or use case, rather than being a widely recognized standard format like PNG, JPEG, or PDF. Here are some key points regarding custom formats: Key Characteristics of Custom Formats Specificity: Custom formats are often tailored to meet the needs of a specific application or system. They may contain unique data structures, headers, or encoding schemes that are not found in standard formats. Magic Numbers: Custom formats typically have unique magic numbers (byte sequences) at the beginning of the file that help identify the format. In your case, the magic number was defined as b’3=U\xb3\xac\xb66|c\xf2\x0f\xe3\xa3\xdc’. Usage: Custom formats are commonly used in proprietary software, specialized data storage, or when a specific data structure is required that standard formats cannot accommodate. Interoperability: Since custom formats are not standardized, they may not be easily readable or writable by other applications unless those applications are specifically designed to handle that format. Understanding Your Custom Format To fully understand what the Custom Format means in your context, you would typically need to refer to the documentation or specifications provided by the application or system that created this format. This documentation would detail the structure of the data, how it is encoded, and how it can be processed. If you have any specific questions about the data contained in this custom format or how to work with it, feel free to ask!

Proprietary Data Format: This could be a format used by a specific application or system that encodes data in a unique way. Often, proprietary formats are not documented publicly.
Serialized Data: If the data is generated by a software application, it might be serialized data (like JSON, XML, or a binary serialization format) that has been compressed or encoded.
Binary Protocol: The sequence might represent a binary protocol used for communication between systems. For example, it could be a message format for a specific network protocol.
Custom Encoding: The data might be encoded using a custom algorithm, which could involve transformations that are not standard.
Next Steps
Inspect the Source: If you have information about how this data is generated or what application created it, that could provide insights into its structure.
Pattern Recognition: Analyzing more examples of similar data might help identify patterns or commonalities that could clarify the format.
Consult Documentation: If the data originates from a specific software or system, checking its documentation might reveal details about its format.
. Choosing a Magic Number or Signature for a Binary File Format
Purpose: A magic number is a unique identifier placed at the beginning of a file to distinguish it from other formats.
Considerations: When choosing a magic number, ensure it is unique and not likely to conflict with existing formats. It should be easy to recognize and document.
2. Custom Binary File Formats
Designing Formats: When creating a custom binary format, consider how the data will be structured and serialized. This includes defining how data types are represented and how to handle versioning for backward compatibility.
Cross-Platform Compatibility: Ensure that the format can be read and written by different programming languages (e.g., C#, Java, Ruby).
3. Unisig - Uniform Signature
Uniform Signature Scheme: Unisig proposes a standard way to define signatures for binary file formats and network protocols.
Features:
Discoverable: Tools can locate signatures at known positions.
Resilient: Clearly differentiates binary data from text and can detect file transfer errors.
Decentralized: Uses URIs for naming, avoiding a central registry.
Implementation: Supports ASCII, Unicode, and UUID formats.
4. File Signatures Table
Comprehensive Resource: A table of known file signatures (magic numbers) that can help identify various file formats based on their initial bytes.
Utility: This resource is useful for cross-referencing the first few bytes of your data against established signatures.
Next Steps
Define a Custom Signature: If you plan to create a custom format, consider defining a unique magic number that can be easily recognized.
Update Your Analysis Script: Incorporate checks against known signatures to improve file format identification.
Utilize Resources: Use the provided resources to guide the creation and identification of your custom data format.
